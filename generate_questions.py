Generate exactly 5 simple, friendly YES/NO survey questions that test if the idea is needed, understandable, and exciting.

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
- Each question MUST be answerable with only "Yes" or "No"
- Questions should NOT ask for ratings, scales, or open-ended responses
- Questions should be clear and direct
- Keep questions short and easy to understand

Examples of good Yes/No questions:
- "Do you think this problem needs to be solved?"
- "Would you use this product/service?"
- "Is this idea easy to understand?"

Only return the 5 questions as a numbered list with no title, no intro.
Each question should be on a new line starting with a number."""
