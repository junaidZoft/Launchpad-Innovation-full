    Generate 5 innovative, student-friendly project ideas for the following UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): {', '.join(selected_sdgs)}.

    Your response MUST be a valid JSON array of objects. Do not include any text or explanations outside of the JSON array.
    
    Each object in the array should represent a single project idea and have the following structure:
    - "title": A short, catchy title for the project.
    - "description": A detailed description (2-3 sentences) of the project. Explain how it addresses the selected SDGs, its feasibility for students aged 14-18, and its potential impact.
    - "technology_focus": The key technology or social innovation involved (e.g., 'Mobile App', 'Data Analysis Platform', 'Community-led Initiative', 'IoT Device').
    - "sdgs_addressed": A list of the specific SDG names it targets from the input list.

    Example of a single JSON object in the array:
    {{
      "title": "Aqua-Alert: Smart Water Quality Monitoring",
      "description": "A project to build low-cost, IoT-based sensors that monitor local water quality in real-time. Students can assemble the sensors and develop a mobile app to visualize the data, alerting communities to pollution and contributing to SDG 6.",
